### Create branch

If you didn't fork and will be using the main repo, use branches. (Essentially making a separate folder so it does not interfere with main branch)

To create a new branch: 
- Run `git branch your-branch`
- Checkout into that branch, `git checkout your-branch`

OR
- Run 'git checkout -b your-branch' to make the branch and switch to it

If you forgot to make a branch before making changes, use the following command:
- Run `git switch -c your-branch`

### Pushing

- Add your changes, run `git add .`
- If you want to add only particular changes then 'git add file-name'

OR

- Use 'git add -i' for an interactive way to select files to commit
  
- Commit your changes `git commit -m "commit-message"` (Note: the message after -m must be in quotes so it is read as a string)
- To push run, `git push origin your-branch-name`

### Pulling 

- Use `git pull origin dev` to pull all the new content in the 'dev' branch into a new branch

### Delete branch locally

- Run `git branch -d your-branch`
- Note: "-d" can be changed to "-D" for force delete

### View branch

View all branches:

- Run `git branch` to see all local branches

View current branch:

- Run `git branch --show-current`

OR

- Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
